## ✅ How to Run the Project

1. **Install Pandas** (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas
Run the script:
python perfomance_report.py

After running, a new file will be created:
agent_perfomance_report.csv
This CSV file contains the number of closed tickets and average response time per agent.

🧪 Example Output
agent_name  closed_tickets_count  average_response_time
Alice       2                     27.5
Bob         1                     35.0
